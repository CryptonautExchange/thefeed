# The Feed
The feed is a market data aggregator with the ability to generate fake data for the purpose of providing mock interfaces for the development of Exchange components. 

Currently the feed only supports poloniex, and soon fake data with a variety of parameters to provide different scenerios and usage patterns. Eventually additional exchanges that provide real-time data streams will be available in order to benchmark components against existing live systems.
